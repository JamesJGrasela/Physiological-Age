Beetles collected from palm crowns into the 3 behavioral phases based on percentage of EEM. Beetles weighing greater than 80% EEM were placed in the “Preflight” category, beetles between 60 and 80% EEM were placed in the “Active” category, and beetles less than 60% EEM were placed in the “Senescent” category.
